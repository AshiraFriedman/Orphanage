							Welcome to the Brooklyn Orphanage:

	Here at the Brooklyn Orphanage, our goal is to give you a place where your kid can come and 
feel no different than any other child, growing up in a stable environment.
We need some help just revamping our system.

Reports needed:
1) Show a list of  all students who enrolled in the orphanage in the 2o century and their age at the time when they entered the sem
2) Show a list of Students who are not from the tri-state area(the tri-state area will include Brooklyn and New Jersey), and their age when they entered the orphanage
3) Show me the Avg how long students tend to stay in the orphanage and the average of boys and girls
4) Write me a format ID for the students, it should look like this ex: (Smith, Peter-07/06/2001)
   							Thank you for your help!
